Application Work flow
=====================

1. Import a library to help create a component
2. Create a component
3. Render it to a device

1. Import statement are from ES6
2. Component is an object that makes something(like text, image) to display on mobile device.
3. JSX is a extension to Java script which is used to write help react components. (http//Babel.ljs.io)

Import Destructuring:

Component Nesting : Placing one component inside another component 

FlexBox Layout mechanism:

Prop: Property. By adding prop we are reconfiguring child(header) to get the data in fly.
State : Whenever we change the state mobile device will render the component itself.Component level state

justifyContent : 'flex-start','flex-end'
flexDirection: 'column','row'
